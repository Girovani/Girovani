### Hi there, i'm Geovani  ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Girovani/Girovani** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Well, for geting started, I'm a high school stundent from Brazil, I'm currently learning about Data Science and I started with my studies in this area about a year ago, so I think there is a long way to go for me. I'm looking to collaborete with any project related with DS, so if you want my help with anything I will be happy to help with whatever I can.

My repositorios will be a mix of diferents education task offered by diferents websites or courses. I will be trying to be the most didatic that I can in my notebooks, (except by the the fist ones) I'm trying to do a diferent thing in each of them, so I hope you enjoy my github and maybe discover something new.

I'm still a newbie, so if you saw something wrong or could be improved (Probably many things will be like this ğŸ˜…ğŸ˜‚) please tell me, I will be very grateful to receive tips.

you can contact through my email: geovani147silva@gmail.com
